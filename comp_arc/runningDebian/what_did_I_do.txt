what did I do:


1) get Android-Kitchen

2) get system image. I got GT-I9100_SER_I9100XWLP2_I9100OXELP4_I9100XXLPQ.zip
from http://goangeek.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/official-ics-links-for-sgs2/

3) extract it and mv file.tar.md5 to file.tar

4) copy the result to Android-Kitchen-homefolder/original_update/

5) run Android-kitchen-homefolder/menu
actions inside are intuitive:
first ask to take the original image => Android-kitchen must accept it
then modify what you want to modify
and then write the result

you will find it in:
Android-kitchen-homefolder/OUTPUT_ZIP

there will be a .zip file. Copy it to smartphone's sd-card (in case of Samsung Galaxy S2 to the internal one)

6) install from App Market Clockwork rom manager

7) reboot into recovery

8) backup your current system

9) reboot and copy it to pc

10) reboot again and flash your new system
